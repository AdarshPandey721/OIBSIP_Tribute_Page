            Nobita Born and raised in Tokyo, Nobita Nobi led an ordinary life,
            Often daydreaming in class, with grades causing him strife.
            His education journey filled with ups and downs,
            But his thirst for knowledge was never bound.
            Though he struggled with academics, he found solace,
            In the company of his friends, sharing laughter and promise.
            Learning important life lessons beyond textbooks and rules,
            Nobita's experiences shaped him into a kind-hearted soul.
